## Program Description
This little bash script (username.sh) checks if a username follows some simple rules. The rules are:

only lowercase letters, numbers, or underscores

it has to start with a lowercase letter

it has to be at least 3 characters long but no more than 12

When you run the program, it shows the rules first, then asks you to type in a username. If what you type doesn’t fit the rules, it’ll tell you and let you try again. Once you finally type something that works, it thanks you and exits.

## Username Requirements
This script validates usernames according to the following rules:
- Must start with a lowercase letter
- Can only contain lowercase letters, digits, and underscores
- Must be between 3 and 12 characters in length (inclusive)

## Usage
To run the script interactively:
```bash
./username.sh
```

To test with the provided input file:
```bash
./username.sh < username-input
```

## How the Script Works
[Explain in 3-5 sentences how your script validates usernames. Include information about:]
- The use of the `while` loop
- The `grep` command with extended regular expressions
- The meaning of the `-E` and `-v` flags
- The redirect `> /dev/null 2>&1`

## Regular Expression Pattern
The validation uses the following regular expression pattern:
```
^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{2,11}$
```
This pattern ensures that:
- The username starts with a lowercase letter `[a-z]`
- The following characters are lowercase letters, digits, or underscores `[a-z0-9_]`
- The total length is between 3 and 12 characters

## Testing Results
[Describe your testing process and results. Include:]
- Example valid usernames you tested (at least two)
- Example invalid usernames and why they fail (at least two)
- How you used the username-input file to test

## Challenges and Solutions
[Optional: Describe any challenges you encountered while creating this script and how you solved them. This could include debugging issues, understanding regular expressions, or Git workflow problems.]
